	<h3>I have had 2 prior jobs. My first job I worked for 3 months at MOD Pizza as a cashier, and left on good terms to pursue education at UW-Milwaukee. My second job was with RGIS as an inventory specialist, which I left when they could not work with my new schedule.</h3><br>
	<h3>In addition, I have 3 weeks of experience with Air Force Basic Training, and will be starting a job with Amazon soon as a seasonal representative.</h3></div>
